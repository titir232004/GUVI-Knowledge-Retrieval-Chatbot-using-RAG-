Shallow copy : Copies the object’s fields, but if the field is a reference (like an array or another object), only the reference is copied—not the actual data. Changes in the referenced object affect both copies. Deep copy : Creates a completely independent copy of the object and all the objects it references. Changes in one object don’t affect the other. 24. What is type erasure in",

Java implements generics through type erasure. This means that all generic type information is removed at compile time , and replaced with raw types or bounds. For example, List<String> and List<Integer> Both become just List at runtime. This ensures backward compatibility but also means generics cannot be used with primitives or checked at runtime. 25.

An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and can contain abstract methods, while an interface is a collection of abstract methods and constants that can be implemented by any class. 28. How does garbage collection work in Java? Java uses an automatic garbage collector (GC) to manage memory. When no live references point to an object, it becomes eligible for garbage collection. GC periodically reclaims this memory so the programmer doesn’t need to explicitly free it (like in C/C++). Methods like System. gc() can request GC, but the JVM decides the actual timing. 29.

You can implement a merge sort algorithm in Java using recursion and a merge method to combine two sorted arrays. Polymorphism in Java refers to the ability of objects of different classes to be treated as if they are of the same class. An example is a superclass Animal with a method makeSound() that is overridden by subclasses Dog and Cat. A daemon thread is a low-priority thread that runs in the background to support other threads. The JVM exits when all user threads finish, regardless of whether daemon threads are still running.

What is the difference between a private and a protected method in Java? A private method is only accessible within the same class, while a protected method is accessible within the same class and any subclass. 33. How do you implement a bubble sort algorithm in Java? You can implement a bubble sort algorithm in Java by iterating through the array and swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. 34. What is the difference between a while loop and a do-while loop in Java? A while loop executes",

What is the difference between a static and non-static variable in Java? A static variable is associated with the class, while a non-static variable is associated with an instance of the class. 38. What is a deadlock in Java? How can you prevent it? A deadlock in Java occurs when two or more threads are blocked waiting for each other to release resources. You can prevent it by avoiding circular dependencies and using thread-safe synchronization. 39. Explain",

How will you store user passwords securely in Java? Passwords must never be stored in plain text. Use a hashing algorithm like PBKDF2 , BCrypt , or Argon2 to convert the password into a fixed-length hash. Store only the hash in the database. At login, hash the input password and compare it with the stored hash. String hashed = BCrypt. hashpw(password, BCrypt. gensalt());",

Answer: Inline functions are functions that the compiler replaces with their actual code during compilation. Instead of performing a function call, the code is “inlined” at the call site. This can improve performance by avoiding the overhead of function calls (stack operations, jumps), particularly for small, frequently-called functions. However, excessive inlining may increase code size, so the compiler decides when to inline a function. 35) What is the",

General MERN Stack Interview Questions and Answers At the fresher level, interviewers focus on basic MERN concepts, fundamental knowledge, and your understanding of development processes. 1. What is the MERN Stack, and why is it popular? The MERN Stack is a combination of four key technologies: MongoDB : A NoSQL database for storing data. Express. js : A lightweight web application framework for Node. js. React : A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Node. js : A JavaScript runtime for server-side development.

MongoDB acts as the database in the MERN Stack, storing data in a flexible, document-oriented format. Instead of traditional rows and columns, MongoDB uses collections of JSON-like documents. This schema-less structure makes it highly adaptable for modern applications where data structures can evolve rapidly. Can you explain the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases ?

Indexing in MongoDB creates a special data structure that stores a small portion of the collection’s data in an easy-to-traverse format. This allows queries to quickly locate the required documents instead of scanning the entire collection. For example, indexing a field like email makes searching users by email much faster. However, adding too many indexes can increase storage usage and slow down write operations, so indexes should be used strategically. 4. How do you handle schema validation in MongoDB? Even though MongoDB is schema-less, you can enforce structure using JSON Schema validation.",

Page object model (POM) can be used in any kind of framework such as modular, data-driven, keyword-driven, hybrid framework, etc. A page object is an object-oriented class that serves as an interface to a page of your Application Under Test(AUT). The tests then use the methods of this page object class whenever they need to interact with the User Interface (UI) of that page. The benefit is that if the UI changes for the page, the tests themselves don’t need to change, only the code within the page object needs to change.",

In general, normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and dependency. Various forms of normalization include: First Normal Form (1NF): This form ensures that there are no duplicates present in the record, i. e. , each column contains atomic values and each record is uniquely identified. Second Normal Form (2NF): This form should meet 1NF requirements and remove partial dependencies, i. , non-key attributes depend on the whole primary key. Third Normal Form (3NF): This",

It doesn’t affect I/O-bound tasks (like file reading or network calls). To fully utilize multiple cores, you can use the multiprocessing module instead of threading.

White spaces are blank sequences of space characters, which are treated as a single space character in HTML. The browser collapses multiple spaces into a single space, so we can indent lines of text without worrying about multiple spaces. This enables us to organize the code into a much more readable format. 28. Do all HTML elements need both opening and closing tags? Ans. Not really, elements like <img src=””/> or <input type=””/> don’t need a closing tag. A marquee is used to enable scrolling text on a web page. So, to do this, just place",

Links can be created using the tag, with referencing through the use of the # symbol. For example, we can have which would result in the words “BACK TO TOP” appearing on the webpage and links to a bookmark named top. We can then create a separate tag like: somewhere on the same webpage so that the user will be linked to that place when clicking on “ BACK TO TOP ”. 31. What are the possible ways to",

CSS can be applied in the following three ways: • Linked: Create a separate. css file and add all the styles for the web page there. Make sure the file is linked to the HTML document(s) using the link tag • Embedded: Inside the HTML document, open a style tag and inside that, add all styles just like you’d do on a linked file. • Inline: This is done by adding a style attribute inside an HTML element. 32.

What is the purpose of the z-index, and how to use it? Ans. The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element within the document area (or a part of it).

A media query consists of a media type and at least one expression that limits the style sheets’ scope by using media features, such as width, height, and colour. Media queries, added in CSS3, let the presentation of content be tailored to a specific range of output devices without having to change the content itself. And, the usage of media queries is similar to this: @media (max-width: 768px) {. problem-class { property: smaller; } } 46. Define event bubbling.

JavaScript does support automatic type conversion, and it is the common way of type conversion used by JavaScript developers. 50. What is event delegation, and how does it work? Ans. Event delegation allows us to avoid adding event listeners to specific nodes of the DOM; instead, the event listener is added to one parent. Using event delegation, it’s possible to add an event handler to an element, wait for an event to bubble up from a child element, and easily determine from which element the event originated. 51.

What is the difference between the window. onload and onDocumentReady? Ans. The window. onload event will not trigger until every single element on the page has been fully loaded, including CSS, images and/or other assets. The main disadvantage is that it might take a while before any code is actually executed. On the other hand, onDocumentReady executes code as soon as DOM is loaded. 52.

An anonymous function is a function declared without any named identifier and in general, is not accessible after its declaration. 54. Explain the role of break and continue statements. • Break statements are used to come out of the current loop • Continue statements continue the current loop with a new recurrence 55.

A close resembles an object. It gets instantiated whenever you call a function. The scope of closure is lexical, meaning everything contained within the function to which the closure belongs, has access to any variable that is in it. A decent example would be: function wcg() { var name = “Web Code Geeks”; function displayMessage() { alert(name); } displayMessage(); } wcg(); wcg()",
